                <h2>Volunteers</h2>
                <p>The tour of centers shows how they are really overwhelmed with children and running out of resources to better help orphans feel loved. 
                   But the lack of staff is impacting too their happiness and some center's risk anytime to get closed.
                   For those plans ahead we focus on the orphans' lives improvement in all the home centers. Passing by staff recruitment to back up the center's volunteers.

                <h2>Health</h2>
                <p>Two of the main plans we have with centers are children's health and better education. 
                    As a part of the project, there is always a need for improvements such as creating new centers, hospitals, 
                    and schools. Building a playfield Sportif that runs about fitness can also helps children with staff have a lot of fun and fulfillment. 
                    Another plan is to work with adoption resources center for each child to have again an opportunity to enjoy family life.
