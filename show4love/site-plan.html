        As the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the way of life of everyone, a lot of families are today scattered in Africa 
        and even across the world. Before that, the frequency stability of the war brought life so tough here. 
        Because of that Orphans increases year to year and children's centers are overwhelmed and lack resources.
      </p>
      <p>With a new approach to better contribute with a site that invites everyone to participate as they could do. 
        This site only relies on any type of donations in order to fund these needs.
        When you donate to the show4love platform, you help a lot the children's center to change every children's life 
        (and the lives of the people who love them).</p>

      <h3>Corrent Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Two of the main challenges we have with the centers are children's health and better education. 
        As a part of the project, there is always a need for improvements such as creating new centers, hospitals, and schools.
        Building a playfield Sportif that runs about fitness helps children with staff have a lot of fun and fulfillment. 
        Work too with the adoption resources center for each child to have again an opportunity to enjoy family life.
