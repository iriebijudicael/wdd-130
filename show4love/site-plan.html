      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This site is to help those children's centers overwhelmed and with few resources in Africa, 
        having a purpose to bring welfare and fulfillment to every orphan's life. 
        We come up with a new approach with a site that only relies on donations in order to fund these needs.
        When you donate to the show4love platform, 100% of your donation goes towards funding projects 
        that change children's lives(and the lives of the people who love them).

      <p>Why this site?</p>

      <p>
        As the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the way of life of everyone, a lot of families are today scattered in Africa 
        and even across the world. More again the instability of geopolitical war created brought life so tough here. 
        Because of that Orphans and jobless increase year to year 
        while children's centers are overwhelmed and lack resources to face the flow of street children.
        Therefore this site will go about ideas and how they could be activities to find resources.
      </p>

      <p>How can we get fundraising?</p>

      <p>We propose a fundraising site that relies on social action to better help orphans feel the peace and love of the world by inviting everyone to donate. 
        The effectiveness of our ideas depends on how well they engage donors, maximize participation, motivate immediate action, and inspire donors to give again.

      <h3>Current projects</h3>

      <p>1. Art Show</p>
      <p>Tap on students creative talents to advance the worthy cause and strengthen the nonprofit's sense of community.  
        Ask each artist to pay a nominal registration fee to showcase their work, then set a flat ticket price for attendees to browse the collection. 
        While asking local artists to get involved as well.
      </p>

      <p>2. Car Wash</p>
      <p>Car washes are often overlooked, but they can be a great way to take a task off someone's to-do list while simultaneously converting them into a supporter of our cause. 
        Host the event at a location that's easily visible and accessible from high-traffic areas. 
        We'll also make sure that we have plenty of space to wash, dry, and collect money from customers.
        Strategize how we plan to promote our upcoming car wash so donors can bake it into their busy schedules. 
        Social media and email are great places to start, but word of mouth can be just as impactful.
      </p>
      
      <p>3. Spelling Bee</p>
      <p>Spelling bees are not only fun to watch, but also present a great opportunity for younger supporters to show their skills. 
        We can advertise our spelling bee event at local schools, gyms, churches, and restaurants, 
        and take the marketing efforts online with a series of social media posts leading up to the event.
      </p>
      <p>4. Bake Sale</p>
      <p>Get ready for some sweet aromas with this classic fundraising idea. To make this fan-favorite event a little more interesting, 
        invite participants to compete to bake the most delectable treat. People can donate for the chance to taste test and vote for their favorites, 
        or scrap the competition idea and simply charge a flat rate for each baked good someone purchases. 
        We are just  sure to review all food serving laws before setting up our table on campus. 
      </p>

      <p>5. Cooking Class</p>
      <p>Whether gathering in person or online, a cooking class is a great way to interact with the community in a relaxed, creative environment. 
        Charge a flat registration fee or offer a fundraising minimum for supporters to earn their spot in class. Then we host the event virtually and charge admission to attend the Livestream. 
        we can also include an incentive for larger donations by offering time with the chef after class for anyone who reaches the tier two fundraising level.

      <h3>Resources</h3>
      
      <p>Volunteers</p>
      <p>The tour of centers shows how they are really overwhelmed with children and running out of resources to better help orphans feel loved. 
         But the lack of staff is impacting too their happiness and some center's risk anytime to get closed.
         For those plans ahead we focus on the orphans' lives improvement in all the home centers. Passing by staff recruitment to back up the center's volunteers.  
      </p>
      
      <p>Health</p>
      <p>Two of the main plans we have with centers are children's health and better education. 
        As a part of the project, there is always a need for improvements such as creating new centers, hospitals, 
        and schools. Building a playfield Sportif that runs about fitness can also helps children with staff have a lot of fun and fulfillment. 
        Another plan is to work with adoption resources center for each child to have again an opportunity to enjoy family life.
